    <h3>Everything for Github can be done in VSCode</h3>

        <ol type="1">
            <li> Initialize a folder to reflect your repository (probably have already done this). </li>
            <ul type="disc">
                <li>Open a folder and/or a file</li>
                <li>Go to the <code>Source Control </code>trident on the left  and click into it</li>
                <li>Click <code>Initialize Repository</code> </li>
            </ul> </br>

            <li> A trident 'main' 'asterik' will now be on the bottom left.</li>
            </br>
            <li> Your file (in this case, <code> index.html</code>) will have a green U to the right of it.</li>
                <ul type="disc">
                    <li>A green U signals an "Untracked" file</li>
                    <li>Untracked files are file changes that have not been added to the repository</li>
                </ul> </br>
            
            <li>Track this file by covering by the U and pressing the + button.
            </li>
            <ul type="disc">
                <li>Pressing + stages the code</li>
            </ul></br>

            <li>Staged files now have an A next to it</li>
            <ul type="disc">
                <li>The A means the file has been staged but that's the only thing that plus does</li>
                <li>Don't click anything yet: at this point, the action is only being described </li>
            </ul></br>

            <li>Next, you'll be <code>committing</code> the staged changes.</li>

           
        </ol>
